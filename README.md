# Thesis-Model
This repository includes a gradient boosting machine learning model which predicts hourly PV energy for a defined time period. This machine learning model is trained using the Past_PV_Power_data_50kW.csv file, which is taken from the European Unions PVGIS database and assumes an installed peak power of 50kW. This prediction is fed into two different scheduling models, a MILP Scheduling Model and a Genetic Algorithm scheudling model. The scheduling models aim to schedule tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment to maximise the use of onsite solar PV energy and minimise electricity costs.
