This repository includes a gradient boosting machine learning model which predicts PV energy for a specific location. This machine learning model is trained using the 

This prediction is fed into two different scheduling models, a MILP Scheduling Model and a Genetic Algorithm scheudling model. The scheduling models aim to schedule tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment to maximise the use of onsite solar PV energy and minimise electricity costs.
